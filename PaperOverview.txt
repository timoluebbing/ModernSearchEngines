Representation vs Interaction focused model
match(q, d) = F(phi(q), phi(d))

Semantic vs Relevance Matching  
Semantic:    similar meaning, meaning based on grammatical structure, similiar meaning based on entire doc
Relevance:  1. exact term matching (BM25 good)
            2. query term imprtance (*bitcoin* news)
            3. matching that works for verbosity vs scope hypothesis


DRMM and how it adresses Relevance Matching:
1. Exact matching signals: 
Therefore choose interaction focused model (otherwise exact terms lost)

2. query term importance
gating mechanism

3. diverse matching
relevance matching not poisiton related (diverse matching requirement) --> choose rather strength preserving matrix (histogram)!

example:
d = [car, rent, truck, bump, injunction, runway]
q = [Woran, liegts]
-> (1, 0.2, 0.7, 0.3, −0.1, 0.1) Interaction ->  [0, 1, 3, 1, 1] Histogram


Training:

Dataset: (nicht soo wichtig)
Robust04: news
ClueWeb: ohne spam
Topic Title/Discription?

Comparison Models (auf zwei drei reduzieren):

Evaluation:
5 fold cross validation
MeanAveragePrecision
rerank based on 2000 best docs from QL model


Results:
DRMM mit LCH und IDF is best 

Reanalysis of DRMM:
No gating, No histogram. Result: no histogramm much worse (since position related)
Term embeddings: 300d sufficient


Future work: larger training data, click through logs (VL), phrase embeddings (local interactions refelct meaning betters)
